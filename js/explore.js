// pseudocode a function that takes a string as a parameter and reverses the string. 
// reverse("hello"), for example, should return "olleh". This isn't a task specific 
// to JavaScript -- your pseudocode should be in plain English and use phrases like 
// "for each" instead of JavaScript-specific terms. Remember that you can add strings 
// in JavaScript, so '' + 'a' would result in the string 'a'. Take your time. This is 
// the most valuable skill in programming: being able to think through a problem logically.

// PSEUDOCODE
// 1. make a function that takes a string as a parameter
// 2. reverse the string. For each index swap with its opposite

// reverse
var str = "hello"

function reverse() {
	console.log(str) 
	
}

reverse()
