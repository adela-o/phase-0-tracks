# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version Control allows us to view the entire history of revisions to one or more files, and merge revisions made by other people. Its useful because its a save point and allows multiple colaborators.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
Branches are where you go to make changes. You use branches to add to files so that you don't mess up/can always go back to the master branch/file.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is what saves the bit of code you just added/changed.

* What is a merge conflict?
When two branches have changed the same part of a file and are merged together.
