## What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
*GNU/Linux gives us the free and open tools that enable us to perform incredibly complex and creative tasks, many of which cannot be performed with any other tools. Many of these small, “do one thing well” GNU utilities are designed using STDIO so that they can be strung together in ways that could never be imagined by the programmers of large, monolithic utilities. In fact, the programmers of these GNU Utilities themselves had no idea of the virtually infinite combinations in which they could be combined to perform tasks they could not imagine. Yet these utilities that are over 40 years old are still in heavy daily use on computers around the world.* - David Both [full article](https://opensource.com/business/15/2/how-linux-philosophy-affects-you)
